    -r      When entered this causes the hash table to use a red-black 
            tree as its container type. 
    
    -s 'table-size'     'table-size' will be the size of the hash table.          
    
    
    -p      This will print out the hash table to standard screen 
            output (stdout).

            the time it took to fill and search the hash table. As well
            as how many unknown words were found. 
            Ex:
                    Fill time : 1.390000
                    Search time : 0.450000
                    Unknown words : 8690
